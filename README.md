# Early-exits Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with expert branches

This repository contains all code developed for the paper "Early-exit deep neural networks for distorted images: providing an efficient edge offloading" by Roberto Pacheco and Rodrigo Couto. Moreover, this repository provides brief guides to help readers reproduce the codes and all the steps in the paper.

Before running the scripts in this repository, you should, first of all, create a virtual environment. Next, download the repository and install the necessary tools and libraries on your computer, including open-cv, pandas, numpy, pytorch, torchvision. To this end, run the requirements.txt file using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
